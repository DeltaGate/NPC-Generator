# NPC-Generator
Version 0.3

Changelog:

Added styling via basic css,
Added New HTML Structure to support style


Version 0.2

Currently the program is in a basic prototype stage, currently the website runs using basic javascript and html to call a function from an external script file that randomly collects a quirk/name/occupation from a related arrey and deposits this on the page for the user to view, the user is able to do this as much as they like.

Next steps will include styling the page to make it more appealing to the eyes as well as then building out functionality and adding a backend database to house data rather than arreys as they take too long to set up correctly and can cause alot of issues with invalid charecters and such.
